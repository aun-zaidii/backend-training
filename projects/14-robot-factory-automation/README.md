# ü§ñ **Robot Factory Automation**

*Your mission: Build an automated factory system that processes robot orders through background jobs and asynchronous workflows.*

## üéØ **Main Learning Focus: Background Jobs & Asynchronous Processing**
Master background job processing, task queues, asynchronous workflows, job scheduling, and building resilient automated systems.

## üè≠ The Factory Challenge

The Mega Robot Factory needs an automated system to handle complex robot assembly orders. Each robot requires multiple manufacturing steps that must be processed asynchronously, with proper error handling, retry mechanisms, and progress tracking.

## üîß Technical Requirements

### **Core Features:**
- **Job Queue System**: Handle multiple types of manufacturing jobs
- **Asynchronous Workflows**: Multi-step robot assembly processes
- **Job Scheduling**: Time-based and dependency-based job execution
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates for each manufacturing step
- **Error Handling**: Retry failed jobs with exponential backoff
- **Worker Management**: Multiple worker processes handling different job types

### **API Endpoints:**
```
POST /orders                         # Create new robot order (triggers jobs)
GET /orders/{id}/status             # Check order progress
GET /jobs/queue                     # View current job queue
POST /jobs/{id}/retry               # Manually retry failed job
GET /jobs/{id}/logs                 # View job execution logs
POST /factory/maintenance           # Schedule maintenance jobs
GET /workers/status                 # View active workers
POST /workers/scale                 # Scale worker processes
GET /analytics/throughput           # Factory performance metrics
```

### **Database Schema:**
- `robot_orders` table (id, customer_id, robot_type, specifications, status, created_at, completed_at)
- `manufacturing_jobs` table (id, order_id, job_type, status, priority, data, created_at, started_at, completed_at)
- `job_logs` table (id, job_id, level, message, timestamp, worker_id)
- `job_dependencies` table (id, job_id, depends_on_job_id, dependency_type)
- `workers` table (id, worker_type, status, current_job_id, last_heartbeat)

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Job Queue**
   - Implement in-memory job queue
   - Create job worker that processes tasks
   - Build job status tracking system

2. **Advanced Job Processing**
   - Priority-based job scheduling
   - Job dependencies and workflow chains
   - Parallel job execution for independent tasks

3. **Error Handling & Resilience**
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Dead letter queue for permanently failed jobs
   - Job timeout and cleanup mechanisms

4. **Worker Management**
   - Multiple worker processes/threads
   - Worker health monitoring and heartbeats
   - Dynamic worker scaling based on queue size

5. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Real-time job progress tracking
   - Performance metrics and throughput analysis
   - Comprehensive logging and debugging tools

## üéÅ Bonus Features
- **Distributed Processing**: Scale across multiple servers
- **Job Scheduling**: Cron-like scheduling for recurring tasks
- **Workflow Engine**: Visual workflow designer for complex processes
- **Resource Management**: CPU/memory usage tracking per job

## üìö Technologies to Explore
- **Job Queues**: `bull` (Redis), `celery` (Python), `sidekiq` (Ruby)
- **Async Processing**: `async/await`, `threading`, `multiprocessing`
- **Scheduling**: `node-cron`, `APScheduler`, `crontab`
- **Monitoring**: Job progress tracking, worker health checks

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Exact Development Time: 5 days**

## üèÜ **Success Criteria:**
- Successfully process complex multi-step manufacturing workflows
- Implement robust error handling with automatic retries
- Build real-time job progress tracking system
- Create scalable worker management system
- Develop comprehensive job monitoring and analytics
