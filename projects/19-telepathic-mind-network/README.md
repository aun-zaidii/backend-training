# 🧠 **Telepathic Mind Network**

*Your connection: Build a real-time communication system that links minds across the psychic realm through WebSocket technology.*

## 🎯 **Main Learning Focus: WebSocket/Real-time Communication**
Master WebSocket connections, real-time messaging, connection management, room-based communication, and building live collaborative systems.

## 🔮 The Telepathic Challenge

Psychics worldwide need a real-time communication network to share thoughts, coordinate telepathic sessions, and maintain mental connections. Build a system that handles live messaging, group mind-links, and real-time presence tracking.

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### **Core Features:**
- **Real-time Messaging**: Instant message delivery between connected minds
- **Room-based Communication**: Group telepathic sessions with multiple participants
- **Presence Tracking**: Show who's online, typing, or in deep meditation
- **Connection Management**: Handle connects, disconnects, and reconnections
- **Message History**: Persistent storage of telepathic conversations
- **Broadcasting**: Send messages to all connected minds or specific groups

### **API Endpoints:**
```
WebSocket: /connect                  # Establish telepathic connection
POST /rooms                          # Create new mind-link room
GET /rooms/{id}/messages             # Get message history
POST /rooms/{id}/join                # Join telepathic session
DELETE /rooms/{id}/leave             # Leave telepathic session
GET /presence/online                 # Get list of online psychics
POST /messages/broadcast             # Send message to all
GET /rooms/{id}/participants         # Get session participants
POST /admin/disconnect               # Admin: Disconnect user
GET /analytics/connections           # Connection statistics
```

### **Database Schema:**
- `psychics` table (id, username, status, last_online, connection_id, room_id)
- `rooms` table (id, name, description, max_participants, created_by, created_at, is_active)
- `messages` table (id, room_id, sender_id, content, message_type, timestamp, edited_at)
- `room_participants` table (id, room_id, psychic_id, joined_at, role, is_active)
- `connection_logs` table (id, psychic_id, action, ip_address, timestamp, user_agent)
