# üó∫Ô∏è **Treasure Map Coordinates**

*Your adventure: Build a geolocation system to track treasure locations and calculate optimal treasure hunting routes.*

## üéØ **Main Learning Focus: Geolocation & Spatial Data Processing**
Master geospatial data handling, coordinate systems, distance calculations, spatial queries, and building location-aware applications.

## üí∞ The Treasure Challenge

Pirates and treasure hunters need a sophisticated system to manage treasure locations, calculate distances between sites, find treasures within specific areas, and optimize treasure hunting routes across the seven seas.

## üîß Technical Requirements

### **Core Features:**
- **Coordinate Management**: Store and manage latitude/longitude coordinates
- **Distance Calculations**: Calculate distances between treasure locations
- **Spatial Queries**: Find treasures within radius, polygon areas, or routes
- **Route Optimization**: Calculate optimal paths visiting multiple treasures
- **Geofencing**: Alert when entering treasure zones
- **Area Analysis**: Calculate area coverage and treasure density

### **API Endpoints:**
```
POST /treasures                      # Add new treasure location
GET /treasures/nearby               # Find treasures within radius
GET /treasures/route                # Calculate optimal route
POST /areas/polygon                 # Define treasure hunting area
GET /areas/{id}/treasures           # Get treasures within area
GET /distance                       # Calculate distance between points
POST /routes/optimize               # Optimize multi-stop route
GET /treasures/clusters             # Group nearby treasures
POST /geofences                     # Create geofence alerts
GET /analytics/density              # Treasure density analysis
```

### **Database Schema:**
- `treasures` table (id, name, latitude, longitude, value, discovery_date, status, description)
- `treasure_areas` table (id, name, boundary_polygon, created_by, area_type)
- `routes` table (id, name, waypoints, total_distance, estimated_time, created_by)
- `geofences` table (id, center_lat, center_lng, radius, alert_type, is_active)
- `location_history` table (id, user_id, latitude, longitude, timestamp, activity_type)

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Geolocation**
   - Store coordinates with proper validation
   - Implement Haversine formula for distance calculation
   - Create coordinate conversion utilities

2. **Spatial Queries**
   - Point-in-circle queries (treasures within radius)
   - Point-in-polygon queries (treasures within area)
   - Nearest neighbor searches

3. **Advanced Calculations**
   - Great circle distance calculations
   - Bearing and heading calculations
   - Area calculations for polygons

4. **Route Optimization**
   - Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver
   - Shortest path algorithms
   - Multiple route optimization

5. **Geofencing & Analytics**
   - Real-time geofence monitoring
   - Spatial clustering algorithms
   - Density heatmap calculations

## üéÅ Bonus Features
- **Elevation Data**: 3D coordinates with elevation tracking
- **Time-based Analysis**: Treasure discovery patterns over time
- **Weather Integration**: Factor weather into route planning
- **Map Visualization**: Generate visual maps with treasure locations

## üìö Technologies to Explore
- **Geospatial**: `PostGIS`, `MongoDB Geospatial`, `Redis GEO`
- **Calculations**: Haversine formula, Vincenty's formula, spherical geometry
- **Algorithms**: TSP solvers, clustering algorithms (K-means, DBSCAN)
- **Libraries**: `geolib`, `turf.js`, `geopy`, spatial calculation libraries

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Exact Development Time: 4 days**

## üèÜ **Success Criteria:**
- Accurately calculate distances using proper geospatial formulas
- Implement efficient spatial queries for location-based searches
- Build route optimization for multi-point treasure hunting
- Create geofencing system with real-time monitoring
- Develop spatial analytics for treasure density and patterns
