# üëΩ **Alien Artifact Archive**

*Your mission: Build a secure digital archive for extraterrestrial artifacts discovered across the galaxy.*

## üéØ **Main Learning Focus: File Upload & Binary Data Processing**
Master file upload handling, binary data storage, file validation, metadata extraction, and secure file management systems.

## üõ∏ The Archive Challenge

The Galactic Archaeological Society needs a system to catalog and store digital scans of alien artifacts. Scientists upload high-resolution images, 3D scans, and research documents that need to be processed, validated, and securely stored.

## üîß Technical Requirements

### **Core Features:**
- **File Upload API**: Accept multiple file types (images, PDFs, 3D models)
- **File Validation**: Check file types, sizes, and scan for corruption
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extract file information (dimensions, creation date, etc.)
- **Secure Storage**: Store files with unique identifiers
- **File Retrieval**: Download files by ID with proper headers
- **Artifact Catalog**: Database records linking files to artifact information

### **API Endpoints:**
```
POST /artifacts/upload          # Upload artifact files
GET /artifacts/{id}/files       # List all files for an artifact
GET /files/{fileId}/download    # Download specific file
GET /files/{fileId}/metadata    # Get file metadata
DELETE /files/{fileId}          # Remove file
POST /artifacts                 # Create artifact record
GET /artifacts                  # List all artifacts
```

### **Database Schema:**
- `artifacts` table (id, name, discovery_location, discovery_date, description)
- `artifact_files` table (id, artifact_id, filename, file_type, file_size, file_path, upload_date, metadata)

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

1. **Setup File Handling**
   - Configure multipart/form-data parsing
   - Set up file storage directory structure
   - Implement file type validation

2. **File Processing System**
   - Create file upload handler with size limits
   - Implement metadata extraction (use libraries like `exifread` for images)
   - Generate unique file identifiers

3. **Database Integration**
   - Design tables for artifacts and files
   - Implement file-artifact relationships
   - Store file metadata and paths

4. **Security & Validation**
   - Validate file types and extensions
   - Implement file size limits
   - Scan files for potential security issues

5. **File Serving**
   - Create download endpoints with proper MIME types
   - Implement streaming for large files
   - Add file access logging

## üéÅ Bonus Features
- **File Compression**: Compress uploaded files automatically
- **Thumbnail Generation**: Create thumbnails for images
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identify and handle duplicate files
- **File Versioning**: Support multiple versions of the same artifact file

## üìö Technologies to Explore
- **File Handling**: `multer` (Node.js), `werkzeug` (Python), built-in file handling
- **Metadata Extraction**: `exifread`, `Pillow`, `PyPDF2`
- **File Validation**: `python-magic`, `file-type` detection libraries
- **Storage**: Local filesystem, organize by date/type folders

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Exact Development Time: 3 days**

## üèÜ **Success Criteria:**
- Successfully upload files of different types (images, PDFs, documents)
- Extract and store metadata for each uploaded file
- Implement secure file download with proper headers
- Create a robust file validation system
- Build a complete artifact cataloging system with file management
