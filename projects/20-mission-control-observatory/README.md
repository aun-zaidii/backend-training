# üöÄ **Mission Control Observatory**

*Your mission: Build a comprehensive logging and monitoring system to track spacecraft operations and system health across the galaxy.*

## üéØ **Main Learning Focus: Logging & Monitoring Systems**
Master application logging, system monitoring, log aggregation, alerting systems, and building observability into backend applications.

## üåå The Observatory Challenge

Mission Control needs complete visibility into spacecraft operations across multiple star systems. Build a robust logging and monitoring platform that tracks system health, detects anomalies, and provides real-time insights for mission-critical operations.

## üîß Technical Requirements

### **Core Features:**
- **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive log capture with different severity levels
- **Log Aggregation**: Collect logs from multiple spacecraft and systems
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live system health tracking and metrics
- **Alerting System**: Automated alerts for critical issues and anomalies
- **Dashboard Analytics**: Visual insights into system performance and trends
- **Log Search & Analysis**: Query logs for troubleshooting and analysis

### **API Endpoints:**
```
POST /logs                           # Submit log entries
GET /logs/search                     # Search and filter logs
GET /metrics/system                  # Get system performance metrics
POST /alerts/rules                   # Create alerting rules
GET /alerts/active                   # View active alerts
POST /alerts/{id}/acknowledge        # Acknowledge alert
GET /health/spacecraft               # Spacecraft health status
GET /dashboards/overview             # Mission control dashboard
POST /monitoring/endpoints           # Register monitoring endpoints
GET /analytics/trends                # System trend analysis
```

### **Database Schema:**
- `log_entries` table (id, timestamp, level, service, message, metadata, spacecraft_id, created_at)
- `system_metrics` table (id, metric_name, value, unit, timestamp, source_system, tags)
- `alert_rules` table (id, rule_name, condition, threshold, severity, is_active, notification_channels)
- `active_alerts` table (id, rule_id, triggered_at, acknowledged_at, resolved_at, status, details)
- `spacecraft` table (id, name, status, last_contact, location, mission_type, health_score)
- `monitoring_endpoints` table (id, spacecraft_id, endpoint_url, check_interval, last_check, status)

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

1. **Logging Infrastructure**
   - Implement structured logging with JSON format
   - Create log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL)
   - Build log correlation with request IDs

2. **Metrics Collection**
   - System performance metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Application metrics (response times, error rates)
   - Custom business metrics for space operations

3. **Alerting Engine**
   - Rule-based alerting system
   - Threshold monitoring for critical metrics
   - Alert escalation and notification routing

4. **Log Processing**
   - Log parsing and enrichment
   - Full-text search capabilities
   - Log retention and archival policies

5. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time system health visualization
   - Historical trend analysis
   - Alerting dashboard with acknowledgment

## üéÅ Bonus Features
- **Distributed Tracing**: Track requests across multiple services
- **Log Streaming**: Real-time log tail functionality
- **Anomaly Detection**: Machine learning-based unusual pattern detection
- **Performance Profiling**: Detailed application performance analysis

## üìö Technologies to Explore
- **Logging**: `winston` (Node.js), `loguru` (Python), structured logging libraries
- **Metrics**: `prometheus`, `statsd`, custom metrics collection
- **Search**: `Elasticsearch`, full-text search engines
- **Monitoring**: Health check systems, uptime monitoring

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Exact Development Time: 5 days**

## üèÜ **Success Criteria:**
- Implement comprehensive structured logging across application
- Build real-time system monitoring with custom metrics
- Create intelligent alerting system with configurable rules
- Develop powerful log search and analysis capabilities
- Build mission control dashboard with health visualization
