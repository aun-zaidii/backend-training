# 🤖 Customer Support FAQ Bot API

## 🎯 **Main Learning Focus: Text Processing & Similarity Algorithms**
Learn text analysis, keyword extraction, string similarity algorithms, and building intelligent matching systems for natural language processing.

## 💬 The Communication Challenge
You've been hired by **TechCorp Solutions** to build an automated customer support system. They receive hundreds of common questions daily and need a **smart FAQ chatbot API** that can automatically answer frequently asked questions and route complex queries to human agents.

## 🎯 Mission Objectives
Create a REST API that manages a knowledge base of questions and answers, processes customer inquiries, and provides intelligent responses. The system should learn from interactions and improve over time through admin feedback.

### Core Features Required:

#### 📚 Knowledge Base Management:
- **FAQ Storage**: Store questions and answers in categories
- **Category Organization**: Group FAQs by topic (Billing, Technical, Shipping, etc.)
- **Answer Matching**: Find relevant answers for customer questions
- **Admin Interface**: CRUD operations for managing FAQs

#### 💬 Chat Conversation System:
- **Customer Sessions**: Track conversations with customers
- **Message History**: Store all messages in a conversation
- **Response Generation**: Match customer questions to stored answers
- **Fallback Handling**: Route unknown questions to human agents

#### 🔍 Smart Matching Logic:
- **Keyword Search**: Find FAQs based on keywords in questions
- **Similarity Scoring**: Rank answers by relevance
- **Learning System**: Track which answers were helpful
- **Response Analytics**: Monitor bot performance and common issues

### API Endpoints Needed:
```
FAQ Management (Admin):
GET /admin/faqs
POST /admin/faqs
Body: { "question": "How do I reset my password?", "answer": "Click 'Forgot Password' on the login page...", "category": "Technical" }
PUT /admin/faqs/{id}
DELETE /admin/faqs/{id}
GET /admin/categories

Chat System:
POST /chat/sessions
Response: { "sessionId": "abc123", "customerId": "optional" }

POST /chat/sessions/{sessionId}/messages
Body: { "message": "How do I reset my password?", "type": "customer" }
Response: { "response": "Click 'Forgot Password'...", "confidence": 0.85, "source": "faq", "requiresHuman": false }

GET /chat/sessions/{sessionId}/messages
Response: [{ "id": 1, "message": "How do I reset password?", "type": "customer", "timestamp": "..." }, ...]

POST /chat/sessions/{sessionId}/feedback
Body: { "messageId": 1, "helpful": true, "feedback": "Perfect answer!" }

Analytics:
GET /analytics/popular-questions
GET /analytics/unmatched-questions
GET /analytics/category-stats
```

### Technical Requirements:
- **Language**: Choose any (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- **Database**: SQLite for storing FAQs and conversations
- **Framework**: Express, Flask, Spring Boot, etc.
- **Text Matching**: Simple keyword matching and scoring
- **Session Management**: Track customer conversations

### Database Schema:
```
Categories:
- id, name, description, createdAt

FAQs:
- id, question, answer, categoryId, keywords, views, helpfulVotes, createdAt

ChatSessions:
- id, sessionId, customerId, status, startedAt, endedAt

Messages:
- id, sessionId, message, type, response, confidence, source, timestamp

Feedback:
- id, messageId, helpful, feedback, timestamp

Type: 'customer', 'bot', 'agent'
Source: 'faq', 'agent', 'fallback'
Status: 'active', 'completed', 'transferred'
```

### Smart Matching Algorithm:
- **Keyword Extraction**: Extract important words from customer questions
- **Similarity Calculation**: Score FAQs based on keyword matches
- **Confidence Thresholds**: Only return answers above confidence level
- **Learning Feedback**: Use feedback to improve future matching
- **Fallback Rules**: Route to human when confidence is low

### Business Logic:
- Return bot response if confidence > 70%
- Suggest "Did you mean?" if confidence 40-70%
- Route to human agent if confidence < 40%
- Track which answers customers find helpful
- Auto-suggest new FAQs based on unmatched questions

## ⏱️ **Exact Development Time: 2 days**
- **Basic API & Database Setup**: Half day
- **FAQ Management System**: Half day
- **Chat Session & Messaging**: Half day
- **Text Matching & Response Logic**: 1 day
- **Analytics & Feedback**: Half day

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- Admins can manage FAQs and categories
- Customers can start chat sessions and ask questions
- Bot finds relevant answers based on keyword matching
- System tracks conversation history
- Feedback system improves answer quality over time
- Analytics show which questions are popular/unmatched
- Proper confidence scoring for responses
- Graceful handling of unknown questions

## 📚 Learning Objectives
