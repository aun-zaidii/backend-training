# 🏰 **Fortress Defense System**

*Your duty: Protect the royal fortress API from siege attacks and resource exhaustion through intelligent rate limiting.*

## 🎯 **Main Learning Focus: Rate Limiting & API Throttling**
Master rate limiting algorithms, API protection strategies, request throttling, quota management, and building resilient API defense systems.

## ⚔️ The Defense Challenge

The Royal Fortress is under constant siege from automated attackers trying to overwhelm the castle's systems. Build a sophisticated API gateway that protects resources using multiple rate limiting strategies while allowing legitimate visitors through.

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### **Core Features:**
- **Multi-Level Rate Limiting**: Per-IP, per-user, per-endpoint limits
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Token bucket, sliding window, fixed window
- **Dynamic Throttling**: Adjust limits based on system load
- **Whitelist/Blacklist**: Trusted allies and known attackers
- **Quota Management**: Daily/hourly usage limits per user type
- **Attack Detection**: Identify and respond to suspicious patterns

### **API Endpoints:**
```
POST /fortress/enter                  # Main entry point (protected)
GET /fortress/status                  # Fortress status (lightly protected)
POST /fortress/supplies               # Resource request (heavily protected)
GET /fortress/visitors                # Current visitor count
POST /auth/login                      # Authentication (specially protected)
GET /limits/current                   # Current user's rate limit status
POST /admin/limits                    # Admin: Adjust rate limits
GET /admin/analytics                  # Admin: View attack analytics
POST /admin/whitelist                 # Admin: Manage trusted sources
```

### **Database Schema:**
- `visitors` table (id, ip_address, user_id, visit_count, last_visit, status)
- `rate_limits` table (id, identifier, endpoint, request_count, window_start, limit_type)
- `user_quotas` table (id, user_id, quota_type, used_count, daily_limit, reset_time)
- `attack_logs` table (id, ip_address, endpoint, attempt_count, blocked_at, attack_type)
- `whitelist` table (id, ip_address, reason, added_by, created_at)

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Rate Limiting**
   - Implement token bucket algorithm
   - Create middleware for request interception
   - Build IP-based rate limiting

2. **Advanced Algorithms**
   - Sliding window rate limiter
   - Fixed window with burst allowance
   - Leaky bucket implementation

3. **Multi-Tier Protection**
   - Per-endpoint custom limits
   - User role-based quotas
   - Global system protection

4. **Attack Detection**
   - Pattern recognition for suspicious behavior
   - Automatic blocking of repeat offenders
   - Escalating response system

5. **Analytics & Monitoring**
   - Real-time rate limit status
   - Attack pattern analysis
   - Performance impact tracking

## 🎁 Bonus Features
- **Distributed Rate Limiting**: Sync limits across multiple servers
- **Adaptive Limits**: Machine learning-based dynamic adjustment
- **Custom Response Messages**: Themed rejection messages
- **Grace Period System**: Temporary limit extensions for verified users

## 📚 Technologies to Explore
- **Rate Limiting**: `express-rate-limit`, `Flask-Limiter`, custom middleware
- **Algorithms**: Token bucket, sliding window, fixed window implementations
- **Storage**: Redis for distributed limits, in-memory for simple cases
- **Monitoring**: Request tracking, analytics dashboards

## ⏱️ **Exact Development Time: 3 days**

## 🏆 **Success Criteria:**
- Implement multiple rate limiting algorithms correctly
- Successfully protect different endpoints with custom limits
- Create user quota management system
- Build attack detection and automatic blocking
- Develop comprehensive rate limiting analytics
