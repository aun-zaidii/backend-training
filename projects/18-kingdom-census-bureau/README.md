# üëë **Kingdom Census Bureau**

*Your mandate: Build a comprehensive reporting system to analyze population data and generate insights for the Royal Kingdom.*

## üéØ **Main Learning Focus: Reporting & Data Aggregation**
Master data aggregation, complex reporting queries, statistical calculations, data visualization preparation, and building analytical reporting systems.

## üìä The Census Challenge

The Royal Kingdom needs detailed population reports, demographic analysis, and statistical insights. Build a system that processes massive census data and generates comprehensive reports for royal decision-making.

## üîß Technical Requirements

### **Core Features:**
- **Data Aggregation**: Complex grouping and summarization of census data
- **Statistical Analysis**: Mean, median, mode, standard deviation calculations
- **Multi-dimensional Reporting**: Cross-tabulation and pivot table generation
- **Time-based Analysis**: Trend analysis and historical comparisons
- **Custom Report Builder**: Dynamic report generation with flexible parameters
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate reports in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, PDF)

### **API Endpoints:**
```
POST /census/data                    # Import census data
GET /reports/population              # Population summary reports
GET /reports/demographics            # Demographic breakdown reports
GET /reports/trends                  # Historical trend analysis
POST /reports/custom                 # Generate custom reports
GET /reports/statistics              # Statistical analysis
GET /reports/export/{format}         # Export reports
POST /analytics/cross-tab            # Cross-tabulation analysis
GET /analytics/outliers              # Detect statistical outliers
GET /dashboards/summary              # Dashboard summary data
```

### **Database Schema:**
- `citizens` table (id, name, age, gender, occupation, income, location, family_size, registration_date)
- `locations` table (id, region, province, city, population, area_km2, classification)
- `occupations` table (id, title, category, industry, average_salary)
- `reports` table (id, report_type, parameters, generated_by, created_at, file_path)
- `report_schedules` table (id, report_type, cron_schedule, recipients, last_run)

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

1. **Basic Aggregation**
   - COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX operations
   - GROUP BY queries with multiple dimensions
   - Filtered aggregations with WHERE conditions

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Percentile calculations (25th, 50th, 75th, 95th)
   - Standard deviation and variance
   - Correlation analysis between variables

3. **Multi-dimensional Analysis**
   - Pivot tables with dynamic columns
   - Cross-tabulation between categorical variables
   - Drill-down and roll-up operations

4. **Time Series Analysis**
   - Year-over-year growth calculations
   - Moving averages and trend detection
   - Seasonal pattern analysis

5. **Report Generation**
   - Dynamic SQL query generation
   - Report caching and optimization
   - Scheduled report automation

## üéÅ Bonus Features
- **Data Visualization**: Chart data preparation for graphs and maps
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Live updating summary metrics
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identify unusual patterns in census data
- **Predictive Analytics**: Population growth forecasting

## üìö Technologies to Explore
- **SQL Analytics**: Window functions, CTEs, advanced aggregations
- **Statistical Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, statistical calculation libraries
- **Report Generation**: `pandas`, `jinja2`, `reportlab` for PDF generation
- **Data Processing**: ETL processes, data cleaning, batch processing

## ‚è±Ô∏è **Exact Development Time: 4 days**

## üèÜ **Success Criteria:**
- Build complex data aggregation queries with multiple dimensions
- Implement statistical analysis functions for population data
- Create dynamic report generation system with flexible parameters
- Develop time-based trend analysis capabilities
- Generate comprehensive reports with proper data insights
